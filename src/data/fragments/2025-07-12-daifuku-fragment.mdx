excerpt: A soft and whimsical Fragment about a daifuku, a cat, and the subtle transformations of the self — shaped by sweetness, curled by winter, and hunched by typing.

豆大福や、なぜ君はそんなに丸いんだい？ 
Oh daifuku, why are you so round?  

猫はこたつでまるくはなるが、  
Cats curl up under the kotatsu, sure —  

私はお腹が丸くなってしまうかも。  
but I may just end up round in the belly.  

大福食べて、猫背になって、我またタイピングす。  
Eating daifuku, slouching like a cat, and I — type once more.
