excerpt: Preparing a home with quiet hospitality in mind — a space for gathering, resting, and gazing toward shared days.

I’m preparing a home where I can welcome everyone.  
Though if I’m going to invite you all, maybe I should tidy it up a little more.

You could relax in the living room,  
grill together in the garden,  
or gaze at the stars from the second-floor balcony.

I wonder—what would you like to do?  
Toward the day I can offer this space as a quiet welcome.

みんなをお招きできる家を整えている。  
でもみんなを招くなら、もうちょっと綺麗にしておきたいかも。

居間でくつろいでも良いし、  
庭でバーベキューをしても良いし、  
2階のベランダで天体観測しても良い。

みんなは何がしたいかな。  
おもてなしできるその日に向かって。
